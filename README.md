## 2D Heat Equation Solver
###   Goal: try the following variations
    - Direct vs Implicit Iterative
    - Crank Nicolson vs Backward Euler
    - Matrix Assembly and Matrix free style implementations
    - Homogenous and Non Homogeneous BC
    
#### Current : Backward Euler, Matrix free, homogenous BC, implicit iterative (Conjugate Gradient);
